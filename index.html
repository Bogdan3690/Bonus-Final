        <h2>Bonus™ lets you sell your home AND continue building equity.</h2>
        <p>When selling your home to Bonus™, not only do you get money for your home today, but we let you share in your home's future value by keeping a percentage of ownership to sell again in the future — it's like profiting twice.</p>
        <ul>

                <p>Bonus Your Home Today</p>
                <h3>Sell your equity to Bonus™ and turn your home into a long-term investment.</h3>
                <a href="">EXPAND</a>
                <p>Selling your home doesn't have to mean giving up its future worth. Bonus™ lets you sell your current equity, move out and still keep ownership in your home. With no showings, no closing costs and lower fees than a traditional sale, Bonus™ is a faster, easier and smarter way to sell, all while keeping your home as a long-term investment!</p>
            </li>

                <p>EXPAND</p>
                <p>With Bonus™, your home receives our white-glove management and care. We take care of everything from maintenance, repairs, and all other expenses to optimize the home for long-term value. You can sit back and watch your equity and home's value grow like a stock. Bonus™ guarantees to never come back to you for any money or costs.</p>

                <p>EXPAND</p>
                <p>As partners in the home, when you win, we win. Bonus™ allows you to keep ownership in the home and keep building equity over the years to cash out later when the home goes up in value. Never miss out on your home's future worth.</p>
